*Introduction*

pyTempNet is a python module for the analysis of time-stamped relational data represented as *temporal networks*. It particularly facilitates the analysis of temporal networks from the perspective of higher-order networks, which include causality limitations due to order correlations. This perspective and the resulting analytic measures have been outlined in the papers: 

1. I Scholtes, N Wider, R Pfitzner, A Garas, CJ Tessone, F Schweitzer: Causality-driven slow-down and speed-up of diffusion in non-Markovian temporal networks, Nature Communications, 5, Sept. 2014
2. R Pfitzner, I Scholtes, A Garas, CJ Tessone, F Schweitzer: Betweenness preference: Quantifying correlations in the topological dynamics of temporal networks, Phys Rev Lett, 110(19), 198701, May 2013

The module is written in pure python, has no platform-specific dependencies and should thus work on all platforms. The latest development version can be installed by typing: 

> pip install git+git://github.com/IngoScholtes/pyTempNets.git
