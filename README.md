# Introduction

`pyTempNet` is a python module for the analysis of time-stamped relational data represented as **temporal networks**. It particularly facilitates the analysis of temporal networks from the perspective of higher-order networks, which include causality limitations due to order correlations. This perspective and the resulting analytic measures have been outlined in the papers:

The module is written in pure python, has no platform-specific dependencies and should thus work on all platforms. The latest development version can be installed by typing: 

`> pip install git+git://github.com/IngoScholtes/pyTempNets.git`
